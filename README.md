EVote
=====

The final project for CS 419 (computer security), was to implement a secure electronic voting system. I shat this out in a few hours. See the PDF for more info.


## Installation

After cloning the repo with `git clone git@github.com:eddiezane/EVote.git` cd
into the directory and run `npm install -d` to install dependencies.

## Running

To start the app, run `npm start`. Visit the CLA at [https://localhost:5000](https://localhost:5000) and the CTF at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000).

## Testing

Run `npm test`. CSRF tokens are sad to test so I pretty much stopped caring.
